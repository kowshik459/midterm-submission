        "Week 0 Report – Build the Algorithmic Black Box\n",
        "Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Week 0 served as a foundational bootcamp for quantitative finance, focusing on Python programming, data analysis, and probabilistic thinking. The goal was to build intuition for how randomness and data-driven methods are used in financial markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python and Financial Data Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "In the initial sessions, I worked with financial time-series data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I learned how to clean raw market data, handle missing values, compute daily returns, and apply rolling window techniques. Visualizations like return histograms and rolling volatility helped in understanding market behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding Randomness and Risk\n",
        "\n",
        "A major highlight of Week 0 was the introduction to stochastic processes. By simulating Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), I observed how asset prices evolve randomly over time. Even with fixed parameters, different simulated paths diverged significantly, emphasizing the role of uncertainty and risk in financial markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "This week reinforced the importance of probabilistic modeling in finance. Rather than predicting exact outcomes, quantitative methods focus on understanding distributions, risk, and extreme scenarios. These concepts form the backbone of algorithmic trading and risk management."
